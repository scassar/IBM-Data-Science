# IBM Data Science Certificate

I have some previous experience dealing with a lot of the technologies in this IBM Data Science course, but this course provided a nice framework to learn all the components of CRISP-DM again. 

I have just included a few of the weeks assignment files where relevant as part of the course. Most of the grading is through tests that require you to physically manipulate the data for answers. 

Overall this is a fantastic course for those interested in Data Science, you can access the course below at the following link to Coursera where you can take this for yourself:
