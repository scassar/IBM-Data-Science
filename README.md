# IBM Data Science Specialisation Certificate

Amazing course provided by IBM. A great framework to learn all the components of CRISP-DM. 

Many of the areas this course focuses on include:

- What is Data Science
- Tools for Data Science
- Data Science Methodology
- Python For Data Science & AI
- Databases & SQL
- Python Project for Data Science
- Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualisation with Python
- Machine Learning with Python
- Capstone Applied Data Science Unit

Throughout the course, we were required to upload files to Github for use in grading.

I have just included a few of the weeks assignment files where relevant as part of the course. Most of the grading however is through online exams that require you to physically manipulate the data for answers. 

Overall this is a fantastic course for those interested in Data Science, you can access the course below at the following link to Coursera where you can take this for yourself
